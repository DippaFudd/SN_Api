Social Network API
## Description
This project is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, MongoDB for the database, and Mongoose as the ODM (Object Data Modeling) library. This API allows users to create, update, and delete users, thoughts, reactions, and friends. The data is stored in a MongoDB database, and the server handles routing and logic for CRUD operations.

## User Story
AS A social media startup

I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database

SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Acceptance Criteria
Given a social network API:

When I enter the command to invoke the application:

Then my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.

When I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts:

Then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.

When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia:

Then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database.

When I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia:

Then I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends from a userâ€™s friend list.
